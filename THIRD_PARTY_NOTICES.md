## Frontend dependencies

The locked npm dependency graph is in web/package-lock.json. The Offline
Bundle carries npm's package metadata/cache required for its exact lockfile.
Vue, Vue Router, Pinia, Vite, Vitest, Vue Test Utils, jsdom, and TypeScript are
used under their upstream license terms. The bundle does not relabel or remove
their notices.

See docs/DEPENDENCIES.md for the machine-readable source locations and direct
dependency inventory.
